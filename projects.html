    <p class="p">In Sophmore year I wrote an essay about things fall apart. I was captivated by the tragic world of Okonkwo as his reality is lost and taken by colinizers. The essay took around 4 weeks to complete and the only source on information was the book by Chinua Achebe. It was personally rewarding to write as I learned lots about the Ibo and greater Nigerian culture.

It was a lesson to teach shading and color pallet change. It took a week of learning ow to make proper gradients, the nanother two weeks to create the painting. I used acrilic paint and applied five coats over the 2 week period. I enjoyed working on the painting and gaining a greater appretiation for the great works of art that I now know are near impossible to create with ones own two hands.</p>
