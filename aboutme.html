    <p class="p">Im a sophmore at Piedmont High School. I take APCSP at school and took the AP test already.. It was pretty easy and I enjoted the class. I don't think I will take APCSA next year though. It seems like too much. 
    Outside of school I play guitar and do crew, over the summer I am going to take some economics courses because it is a field I want to go into.
